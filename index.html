						<h2>Hey there! I'm <strong>Sai</strong>.</h2>
						<p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 35px; text-align: justify;" >
							I am a computer science undergraduate student at <span><a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/" style="color: #bb09f1"> NYU Tandon</a></span> in New York City. I minor in <span> <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/departments/finance-and-risk-engineering" style="color: #ff531a">Finance</a></span> and <span> my concentrations are in <span> <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/research/areas-excellence/data-science-ai-robotics" style="color: #2bdb08">Artificial Intelligence & Data Science</a></span>. During my time at university, I embraced every opportunity to deepen my knowledge and expertise. I undertook the prestigious course CS50: Introduction to Computer Science and Programming at Harvard University, delving into the intricacies of algorithms, data structures, web development, cybersecurity, and much more. This experience broadened my horizons and fueled my passion for continuous learning. The two things I value the most are innovation and good teamwork. I have also participated in various coding programs and projects that have honed my skills and I am always looking for more opportunities to do so.
						</p>
						<p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 35px; text-align: justify;" >
							The summer after my freshman year, I was a <i>software enginnering intern </i> at <span><a href="https://www.cozentus.com/" style="color: #008000"> Cozentus Technologies</a></span> where I worked on a backend development of their whitelabel AI & Data Science application to increase the efficiency of data extraction, mapping and conversion into the AI model. During the internship, I collaborated with a dynamic team to drive innovation and problem-solving in an AI-driven environment. Additionally, in Fall 23 I will be working in a Vertically Integrated Program<span><a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/student-research/vertically-integrated-projects" style="color: #de0bde">(VIP)</a></span> as a data analyst in the <span><a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/student-research/vertically-integrated-projects/vip-teams/data-analytics-visualization-gy" style="color: #ee1313"> Data-Analytics-Visualization team</a>. This unparalleled opportunity will allow me to harness my passion for data-driven insights, collaborate with talented individuals, and contribute to innovative projects that transcend boundaries and make a lasting impact.

                    <p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 35px; text-align: justify;" > Beyond technology, I believe in giving back to the community. As a volunteer at HelpAge India NGO, I raised funds for a personal alert system, ensuring the safety and care of the elderly in times of need. I also dedicated my time as a Student Volunteer at Smile: For Children's Health and Education NGO, teaching underprivileged students and contributing to the establishment of a new library!</p>

                    <p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 35px; text-align: justify;" > In my personal portfolio, you'll witness the culmination of my endeavors, the manifestation of my passion for technology, and my unwavering commitment to innovation. Join me on this extraordinary journey as I continue to push the boundaries of what's possible in the ever-evolving world of technology. </p>
